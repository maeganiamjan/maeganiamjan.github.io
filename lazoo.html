      <h1>May, 2020 –</h1>
       <p>The L.A. Zoo is closed until further notice following the City’s Safer at Home Order to help slow the spread of coronavirus and avoid a surge in the number of cases that would overwhelm our hospitals. The City of Los Angeles will take a gradual and staged approach in its response to this crisis. The Mayor will be working with leaders across the region and continuing to be guided by expertise from County, State, and Federal public health officials. This approach will enable the City of Los Angeles to slowly lift restrictions while carefully monitoring risks and needs, and adjusting their approach as needed. This strategy will be slow, deliberate, coordinated, and driven by data and public health criteria. For more information about the City’s roadmap to safely reopening, please visit Mayor Garcetti’s Safer L.A. website https://corona-virus.la/SaferLA.</p>

      <h1>HIPPO HELP</h1>
      <h2>Hippos need help?</h2>
      <p>What's in a name? Watch a hippo, on land or in the water, and you’ll soon discover that this roly-poly is one of the animal world’s great characters. It is the most rotund land mammal and spends its daytime hours in lakes, pools, mudholes, or in the preferred moving waters of rivers. </p>
      <h3>COME MEET PUDDLES!</h3>
      <p>Puddles was the LA ZOO’s first hippopotamus; born on July 8, 1935 at the Brookfield Zoo outside of Chicago. He arrived here in August 1936, becoming the first hippo to be exhibited by a zoo on the West Coast. He became quite the viewing sensation.</p>

                          <h1>GIRAFFE'S GAME</h1>
      <h3>Hello up there! </h3>
      <p>Why do so many people look up to giraffes—besides the obvious reason? The long and short of it is that they are a wonderful example of nature’s creativity. 
Giraffes are the tallest land animals. A giraffe could look into a second-story window without even having to stand on its tiptoes! A giraffe's 6-foot (1.8-meter) neck weighs about 600 pounds (272 kilograms). The legs of a giraffe are also 6 feet (1.8 meters) long. The back legs look shorter than the front legs, but they are about the same length. A giraffe's heart is 2 feet (0.6 meters) long and weighs about 25 pounds (11 kilograms), and its lungs can hold 12 gallons (55 liters) of air! </p>
<h2>GAMES WITH LOFTY AND PATCHES</h2>
      <p>Giraffes have drawn long looks from the LA ZOO guests since 1938. Lofty and Patches were the Zoo’s first giraffes, arriving from Africa with much fanfare. Loading their secure carriers off the ship and onto the truck for the long journey from New York to Los Angeles was quite a production, and upon their arrival here 10 days later, the giraffes refused to leave their traveling carriers. Finally, someone offered them onions, and these veggies accomplished what nothing else could do. 

        The Zoo currently has a small herd of Masai giraffes that share the habitat in Urban Jungle with the much smaller Nubian Soemmering’s gazelles, adding interest for the animals and our guests. The Zoo has giraffe feeding opportunities. When you visit, be sure to check out the giraffe feeding times!</p>

                          <h1>PLAYTIME PENGUINS</h1>
      <h2>Penguins & Friends Tour</h2>
      <p>You're watching African penguins at the big, new Dan & Vi McKinney Penguin Habitat in Conrad Prebys Africa Rocks. You might also spot some of their pool mates, leopard sharks. But don't worry, the two species get along swimmingly!
        <p>
        Our flock of African penguins  can be seen in the big, new Cape Fynbos habitat at the LA ZOO’s Conrad Prebys Africa Rocks. The spacious Penguin Beach features a cobblestone beach, nesting areas, and rockwork that mimics the granite boulders found at Boulders Beach in South Africa—along with a 200,000-gallon pool with depths up to 13 feet, and underwater viewing. </p>
        <p>
        As one of the most endangered types of penguin, these little birds need your help! Their numbers have declined by 60 percent in the last 28 years. The African penguins at the Zoo are just the beginning of a large flock that we hope to have over the next couple of years, and start breeding this species. It is important for people to learn about this endearing species.
        </p>
      <p>This tour includes a great view of our African penguin colony with special private viewing of the penguin beach and nesting area. You'll get the inside scoop on how we care for these unique birds, and learn how we are working to conserve them in the wild. Enjoy other unique animal experiences as you tour the Zoo with one of our knowledgeable guides!
